# CoolerBot
A JavaScript based Discord bot using discord.js for use with the Arma community The Cooler Server.

## Limitations and Intent

This is designed explicitly to work on only The Cooler Server's discord server.  However, I host this here for three purposes:

* My own organization, as I am a messy individual
* Allow community members of The Cooler Server to contribute to the project
* Allow anyone else to possibly use the odd and ends I do for thier own

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
